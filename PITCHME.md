## Quantifying Tech Debt
 
#### Ideas to eliminate and find tech debt.

### What is tech debt?

- Has become a loose, umbrella term

Note:
* Catch all for bad code, not writing tests
* Putting off refactoring
* Not using the latest libs

### What is tech debt?

> "As an evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting  
> deteriorating structure, increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it."

Meir "Manny" Lehman, 1980

### What is tech debt?

> "A little debt speeds development so 
> long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite... 
> The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right 
> code counts as interest on that debt. 
> Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under excess debt..."

Ward Cunningham, 1992

Note:

* Kinda ages ago
* re-worded slightly to fit
* Every extra minute spent is an interest payment
* Key point, is incurring interest only when spending time on it
* function of time
* Not all tech debt is equal
* Various interest rates based on quality as well as time spent on it

### What problems does it cause?

- Cause defects
- Slow down development of new features |
 - Directly: when implementing the feature |
 - Indirectly: by taking time away through maintenance |

Note:
* Through misunderstanding of overly complex code
* Through not applying DRY
* Through inefficient code/architecture
* Maintenance: bug squashing, manual intervention

### How is it created?

Note:
* All can produce it
* Top right common in startups
* Bottom right is common case
* Bottom left, lack of knowledge
* Bad culture, we don't want to see

### How is it created?

- many
- ways |
- Repeatedly changed code incurs debt organically |

Note:
